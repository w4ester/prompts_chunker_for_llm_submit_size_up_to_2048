Running the Script:

Processing and Storing Chunks: 
Place your text file in the project directory and execute the script with Python. 

Make sure your virtual environment where Python is set up is active.

Retrieving and Using Chunks: Use the retrieve_chunks() function within the script or integrate it into your application to get the chunks for further processing.
